See our Intro to UI Agents . Install In a new uv environment: uv pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/openapps.git For other installation options and online shop setup see Installation . Run OpenApps uv run launch.py App variations Each app can be modified with variables available in config/apps . You can override any of these via command line: uv run launch.py app.todo.title = 'Super Todo' OpenApps also comes with pre-defined variations that can affect the content and appearance of apps. Appearance challenging font export APPEARANCE = challenging_font dark theme export APPEARANCE = dark_theme default export APPEARANCE = default Launch specific apps with selected appearance: uv run launch.py apps/start_page/appearance = $APPEARANCE Or specific apps with: apps/calendar/appearance=$APPEARANCE .

You can see the specific variables for each defined in the individual apps. For example, config/apps/maps/appearance/dark_theme.yaml .

For example agent=dummy is a simple agent that clicks randomly on any buttons, great for exploration!

For example agent=dummy is a simple agent that clicks randomly on any buttons, great for exploration!

Note: To test the ability of a model to navigate the UI without simplified HTML, set: agent.use_axtree=False To see the agent solving the task live: uv run launch_agent.py browsergym_env_args.headless=False Tasks coming soon! Launch Agent(s) Across Multiple Tasks launch thousands of app variations to study agent behaviors in parallel coming soon! Testing Run all tests via: uv run - m pytest tests / Attribution Our apps are built on top of several excellent frameworks: FastHTML framework and examples which allowed us to build fully functional apps in Python, the language most familiar to AI researchers.
